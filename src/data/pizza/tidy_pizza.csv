People's Pizza,Benjamin,Cherry Hill,2021-04-15,13.99,2.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,Consistent coloring. Basic but very satisying crust/sauce/cheese. Nothing fancy but not lacking either. ,#d99011

Genova's,Benjamin,Audubon,2021-04-22,13.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,"I liked the garlic in the sauce, but could have used more cheese and another minute or two in the oven. Crust was made with love.",#d99011

King of Pizza,Benjamin,Cherry Hill,2021-05-02,14.99,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,"Cash only. Looked amazing at first glance, but wasn't as good as I hoped. Crust is a little too thick, but I liked the cheese. ",#d99011

Tony's Pizza,Benjamin,Haddonfield,2021-05-12,12.99,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,"Saucy, which I like. Crust was surprisingly good. It was salty and had a nice chew. Finished 4 slices easily, since it was thin. Would go there again. ",#d99011

Antonino's,Benjamin,Audubon,2021-05-17,14.4,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,Perfect balance of cheese and crust and cooked exactly the right amount of time. Crust tasted and felt great. Very substantial slices (could feed 3 or even 4 people). No way this isn't in our final top 3.,#d99011
Antonino's,Carolyn,Audubon,2021-05-17,14.4,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,amazing from the first bite. Truly stuffed after eating,#cb0000
Bistro Pizzeria,Benjamin,Collingswood,2021-05-26,12.99,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,"Better than I expected. Needed about 50% more sauce. Crust was excellent and the pizza was cooked perfectly, but lack of sauce dried it out a little for me. Would eat a slice there any day.",#d99011
Bistro Pizzeria,Carolyn,Collingswood,2021-05-26,12.99,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,Like really good bowling alley pizza. Thin. Crust very good.,#cb0000
Nicky B's,Benjamin,Haddonfield,2021-06-05,13.49,1.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,"Nice flavor in the sauce, but the crust wasnt doing it for me. I like when they include the tiny 3 leg table.",#d99011
Nicky B's,Carolyn,Haddonfield,2021-06-05,13.49,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,"The couple slices that were greasier were better. Otherwise, mediocre pizza. ",#cb0000
Bruno's,Benjamin,Haddon Township,2021-06-13,14.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,"Very good. First bite was salty and perfect. Could have used a little more cheese, but really enjoyed it. Reminded me of the pizza joints of my childhood (Scottos in Berlin, or Nino's in Hammonton)",#d99011

Joe's Pizza,Benjamin,Cherry Hill,2021-07-15,13.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,Nearly perfect. First bite was as good as the last. Crust and sauce hit exactly like they should. I need to order another one just to make sure this wasn't a fluke.,#d99011
Joe's Pizza,Carolyn,Cherry Hill,2021-07-15,13.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,Was very hungry but I think it was still pretty great. The oil was great but needed more spread out. Crust was my fave,#cb0000
House of Pizza,Benjamin,Pennsauken,2021-08-17,12.99,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,"Crust tasted great, but was almost too thin. Would have been better with thin crust and more cheese, but overall didn't feel substantial enough. Felt cheaply made, but definitely hit the spot.",#d99011

Brooklyn Pizza,Benjamin,Haddon Heights,2021-08-21,15.99,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,Crust and sauce are incredible. Would give the crust a 6 if I could. I could only eat 3 slices because the pizza was so substantial.,#d99011
Brooklyn Pizza,Carolyn,Haddon Heights,2021-08-21,15.99,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,I think I was expected to love this one (being Brooklyn and all) but I wasn't that impressed. It was good but I think the sauce overpowered the cheese and I'm way more of a cheese person than sauce. ,#cb0000
Nick and Joes,Benjamin,Westmont,2021-09-10,13.29,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,Ovrcooked. Pretty disappointed because I've had good pizza here in the past. The mozarella sticks were good.,#d99011
Nick and Joes,Carolyn,Westmont,2021-09-10,13.29,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,Goodness. I hope that was a fluke. Not the pizza I remember. Kinda overcooked.,#cb0000
Pepperoni Pizza,Benjamin,Oaklyn,2021-10-03,12.99,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,"Fantastic pizza. Balanced and cooked perfectly. Crust was the star and had the right amount of chew/flavor. Salad was excellent, too. Watched the Many Saints of Newark while we ate it, so maybe that helped.",#d99011
Pepperoni Pizza,Carolyn,Oaklyn,2021-10-03,12.99,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,Definitely one of the best. Great crust. Good thickness of cheese.,#cb0000
Toscana's,Benjamin,Audubon,2021-11-15,15.99,4.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,"It's pizza. First bit was surprisingly good, but mostly downhill after that. Ate 4 slices easily because it was think. Maybe a tiny bit over cooked and could have used more cheese.",#d99011
Toscana's,Carolyn,Audubon,2021-11-15,15.99,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,I only ate 4 slices because the crust was the majority of the pie that you had to to fulfill your appetite! ,#cb0000

Tacconelli's,Benjamin,Maple Shade,2022-01-19,15.5,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,It might be unfair to judge this pizza. We should've eaten it straight out of the oven but it's not OUR fault they haven't opened Haddon Twp location yet.,#d99011
Tacconelli's,Carolyn,Maple Shade,2022-01-19,15.5,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,"Through no fault of resturant was not hot. Ordered extra cheese but definiteluy didn't get it. So while it was good, disappoiinted.",#cb0000
